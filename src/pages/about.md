Hi, I'm **Gautam Sabhahit** — a product-focused engineer, founder, and former CTO who loves turning complex tech into usable products.

I've spent the past 6+ years building and scaling products at the intersection of **AI, Blockchain, and SaaS** — from architecting systems at **Amazon Pay** (BNPL & EMI) to scaling my own **blockchain data analytics startup** to **$400K revenue** before exiting.

Today, I'm building tools that make AI more practical and product-ready —  
like a **multi-tenant RAG knowledge bot** that lets teams chat with 100+ types of documents, and an **AI demo assistant** that explains products interactively using screenshots & GIFs.

## 🎯 What Drives Me

I believe great technology isn't about the model — it's about **usability, clarity, and outcomes**.  
That's what I focus on — designing products that people actually want to use.

I write here about:
- **AI infrastructure and product design**
- **RAG systems and knowledge automation**
- **Scaling engineering teams and SaaS architecture**
- **Lessons from startup building**
